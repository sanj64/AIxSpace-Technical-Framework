# Quantum Module

This module is intended for implementing the quantum computation components of the framework.

## Overview
This folder will contain code and documentation related to quantum-enhanced algorithms, frameworks, and modules that interface with classical AI models.

## Goals
- Explore use of quantum circuits in AI decision-making.
- Develop basic quantum operations and logic gates.
- Integrate quantum routines into the main framework.
