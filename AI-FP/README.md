# AI-FP (Failure Prediction)

This module is responsible for forecasting component failures before they occur.

## Purpose
The Failure Prediction (FP) module analyzes historical and real-time telemetry data to identify patterns indicative of an upcoming hardware or software fault.

## Inputs
- Raw telemetry data streams (temperature, voltage, etc.).
- Component maintenance logs.

## Outputs
- A structured alert containing the component at risk, probability of failure, and estimated time-to-failure.
