# AI-RRA (Risk & Resource Allocation)

This module acts as the logic core for assessing risk and allocating resources efficiently.

## Purpose
The Risk & Resource Allocation (RRA) module evaluates alerts from other systems. It assesses the overall risk to the mission and determines the best way to allocate resources (like power, data bandwidth, or observation time) to mitigate the risk while minimizing impact on mission objectives.

## Inputs
- Structured alerts (e.g., from AI-FP).
- A database of mission priorities and resource availability.

## Outputs
- A recommendation for resource allocation or a corrective action plan.
